# Vellium User Guide

![Vellium icon](../vellium-icon.png)

Vellium is a local-first desktop/workbench app for:

- AI chat and RP workflows
- long-form writing workflows
- characters and LoreBooks
- knowledge collections and RAG
- autonomous agent workflows over a selected workspace
- MCP / tool calling
- local plugins and themes

This guide documents the current UI and is based on the real app areas: `Welcome`, `Chat`, `Writing`, `Agents`, `Characters`, `LoreBooks`, `Knowledge`, `Settings`, and plugin-powered surfaces.

The screenshots in this guide are local captures from the current app build. Where it makes onboarding clearer, they use `Simple Mode` so the first-run flow matches what many users will actually see.

## Workspaces

| Area | Main job | Usually configured together with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Chat` | Dialogues, RP, tool calling, translation, TTS | `Characters`, `LoreBooks`, `Knowledge`, `Settings` |
| `Writing` | Books, chapters, scenes, drafts, summaries, lenses | `Characters`, `Knowledge`, `Settings` |
| `Agents` | Ask/build/research workflows over a workspace with tools, traces, and resumable runs | `Settings`, provider profiles, workspace/tool security |
| `Characters` | Importing and editing character cards | `Chat`, `Writing` |
| `LoreBooks` | World facts, trigger keys, scripted prompt injections | `Chat` |
| `Knowledge` | Retrieval collections for RAG | `Chat`, `Writing`, `Settings` |
| `Settings` | Providers, models, UI, prompt stack, security, plugins, MCP | Everything |
| `Plugin tabs / widgets` | Plugin-powered extensions and extra UI surfaces | `Settings -> Plugins` |

## Recommended Learning Order

1. Finish the [quick start](./getting-started.md) and create your first working provider profile.
2. In `Settings`, choose an active chat model.
3. Open `Chat` and send a simple message without a character first.
4. Add or import a character in `Characters`.
5. If your workflow needs world facts, create a LoreBook.
6. If your workflow needs retrieval, create a knowledge collection in `Knowledge`.
7. For workspace automation, create an `Agents` thread after providers and tool/security settings are configured.
8. Only after that move on to multi-character scenes, writer workflows, plugins, and MCP.

## Important Things to Know Up Front

- Vellium is not tied to a single backend. Chat, translation, compression, TTS, and RAG can all use different models.
- `Local-only mode` limits the app to localhost or private-network endpoints.
- Tool calling through MCP only works with OpenAI-compatible chat/completions providers, not with KoboldCpp.
- Agents can use first-party workspace tools when enabled. Command execution, network commands, destructive file operations, and git writes are separately gated in settings.
- `Knowledge` and `LoreBooks` solve different problems: one is retrieval-based, the other is trigger-based scripted context.
- Plugins in Vellium are local extensions. Treat their permissions the same way you would treat shell tools or third-party scripts.

## Screenshot Notes

- `Welcome`, `Chat`, and `Writing` screenshots in this guide use `Simple Mode`, because that is the cleaner default for first-time onboarding.
- `Knowledge` and `Settings` screenshots use the standard workspace layout, since those sections are not meaningfully simplified in the same way.
